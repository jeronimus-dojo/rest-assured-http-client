# rest-assured-reqres

My attempt at using the **Page Object Model** design pattern in an API context, that is each endpoint is a class.

It uses the **reqres** api: https://reqres.in/

To see it in action from the terminal run **mvn test**

There are a few basic assertions for each endpoint, and each endpoint is also verified against the OpenAPI spec.
